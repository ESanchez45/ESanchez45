###    1. Cave Diver (Java II)

The cave diver program is a gui that consists of a 10 x 10 grid and each cell on the grid represents a part of a cave, each of the having a different shade of blue with a number 1 - 10 corresponding to the depth of that part of the cave. The program then uses a recursive algorithm to find a path out of the cave that suits the diver's depth rating which is entered by the user. If a path is found, then the path found is marked in red, although if a path isn't found an error message pops up saying that no path has been found. 


###     2. PlaceHolder (Data Structures and Algorithms)
